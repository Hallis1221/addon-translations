# ISSUES
*The github page have issues disabled so i made this little file to suggest things and open issues, just a temporary solution til issues are open on the repo.*

**Suggestions**
1. Use crowdin for translations
2. Get more maintainers/contributers/Admins
3. Create files for all 30 langs (could be done with python) so the translators don't have to.
